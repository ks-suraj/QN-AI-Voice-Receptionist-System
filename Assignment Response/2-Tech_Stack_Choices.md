| **Backend Runtime**            | **Python (FastAPI microservices)**                    | AI ecosystem, multiple ML,AI,Automation libraries, supports async programming, easy and faster development, personal experience  | lower throughput compared to Go/Rust, yet acceptable as AI ecosystem would dominate |
| **Web Framework**              | **FastAPI**                                           | Aync I/O availability, supports pydantic, developer friendly and faster, easier and adaptable                 | a sacrifice on latency w.r.t Go servers yet faster developer ecosystem                            |
| **Primary Database**           | **PostgreSQL**                                        | Best for production, ACID properties, accepts relational query, extensions availability                                                | not good for large document searching, but since we have vector dbs, we can offload there.                       |
| **Cache Layer**                | **Redis**                                             | very low latency, session store option, good for streaming processes                                     | Careful and detailed planning, should have a backup scenari on ready               |
| **Message Queue**              | **Kafka**                                             | High throughput, durable, best for event-driven pipelines (transcripts, intents, dispositions).             | Operationally complexity and managment costs but helps for throughput.                     |
| **Vector / Search DB**         | **Qdrant**                              | Cost efficient, heavy data and workloads and Open source.                                                                | Not simple as Pinecone and not hybrid search as Weaviate but performance wins for Qdrant                       |
| **Job Scheduler**              | **Celery + Redis / Kubernetes CronJobs**              | asynchronous task execution, analytics ETL, scheduling enable and retries.                                                                     |needs heavy monitoring extra moving nodes.                         |
| **Monitoring & Logging**       | **Prometheus + Grafana + ELK (ElasticSearch / Loki)** | SIP metrics, ASR latency, LLM latency, queue lag, TTS error, log search, traces.                                                                       | Operational overhead, storage-heavy, complexity but good for heavy production.                              |
| **Deployment & Orchestration** | **Kubernetes (EKS/GKE)**                              |auto-scaling media servers, ASR workers, LLM inference microservices, stateless APIs.          | Harder DevOps maturity, costly at initially stage but better for production.                                       |
| **Telephony Provider** | **Twilio SIP + Voice API**                              |Global PSTN , webhook, low friction, real time         | Higher per call cost, chances of vendor lock in, but reliable and higher market reach                                       |
| **Real-Time protocol** | **WebRTC(for media) + WebSockets(for signlaing)**                              |Jitter buffering, secure media, SFU compatability         |More Infra and more complex but better for grade audio                                       |
| **Dialogue Framework** | **Hybrid : State Machine + LLM Agent**                              |Determinism (state machine), intelligent layer (LLM), escalation flow        |Higher desing complexity, Higher computational better for multi approach, might have hallucinations but reliability and naturalnaess factor would dominate                                       |
