| **Backend Runtime**            | **Python (FastAPI microservices)**                    | AI ecosystem, multiple ML,AI,Automation libraries, supports async programming, easy and faster development, personal experience  | lower throughput compared to Go/Rust, yet acceptable as AI ecosystem would dominate |
| **Web Framework**              | **FastAPI**                                           | Aync I/O availability, supports pydantic, developer friendly and faster, easier and adaptable                 | a sacrifice on latency w.r.t Go servers yet faster developer ecosystem                            |
| **Primary Database**           | **PostgreSQL**                                        | Best for production, ACID properties, accepts relational query, extensions availability                                                | not good for large document searching, but since we have vector dbs, we can offload there.                       |
| **Cache Layer**                | **Redis**                                             | very low latency, session store option, good for streaming processes                                     | Careful and detailed planning, should have a backup scenarion ready               |
| **Message Queue**              | **Kafka**                                             | High throughput, durable, best for event-driven pipelines (transcripts, intents, dispositions).             | Operationally complexity and managment costs but helps for throughput.                     |
| **Vector / Search DB**         | **Qdrant**                              | Cost efficient, heavy data and workloads and Open source.                                                                | Not simple as Pinecone and not hybrid search as Weaviate but performance wins for Qdrant                       |
| **Job Scheduler**              | **Celery + Redis / Kubernetes CronJobs**              | asynchronous task execution, analytics ETL, scheduling enable and retries.                                                                     | Less suitable for extremely high throughput; needs monitoring.                         |
| **Monitoring & Logging**       | **Prometheus + Grafana + ELK (ElasticSearch / Loki)** | Complete observability: SIP metrics, ASR latency, LLM latency, queue lag, TTS errors.                                                                       | Operational overhead of running ELK stack; storage-heavy.                              |
| **Deployment & Orchestration** | **Kubernetes (EKS/GKE)**                              | Best fit for auto-scaling media servers, ASR workers, LLM inference microservices, and stateless APIs. Enables horizontal scaling for 10× traffic.          | Requires DevOps maturity; costly at early stage.                                       |
